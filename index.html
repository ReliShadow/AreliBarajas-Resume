        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello, I am Areli Barajas and nineteen years old. I enjoy watching streams and learning new things like a new language. I am currently learning German as Iâ€™m already fluent in English and Spanish. Following storylines that being on the web or live streamed or book series is another hobby I do daily. Mystery has also been a favorite topic of mine, so I am interested in Law maybe being a detective one day. Listening to rock music or watching theories like, for example, Game theory get me thinking about school or topics worldwide. I like to educate myself with videos or with new tik toks that may come out. With my newfound knowledge, I feel accomplished in keeping myself productive. During the school year, I tend to make myself helpful by going to organizations or clubs which offer help to the community or the school itself. After a fellow member of the dance community in the past, I enjoyed helping other students learn dances from the classes we took and performing in front of audiences.  I enjoy helping others and working around obstacles that might be in the way. 
<br><br>

        I work hard no matter what Iâ€™m working on, like in school or at a job. Iâ€™m a fast learner, so I will learn to adapt to whatever task Iâ€™m handed. Growing up, I learned to do most things for my parents since they donâ€™t understand English. For most of my other family members, I do the same since their children are much too young to understand the responsibilities of growing up. I enjoy working with technology since I tend to figure out the settings and what to do. I like to collaborate with others, and I wonâ€™t cause problems for other people as I know the work has to be done by a specific date and time. If the workers in the workspace slack off or donâ€™t want to do the job, I will speak to them or report them rather than doing the work on my own. Like for example, people would just do all the work themselves, but the other group members would also get the credit for the work that was meant to be dueâ€”no mercy in the workspace since thatâ€™s how life is. 
<br><br>

        Iâ€™m studying my recent major Chicano studies as a professor in this field of study had visited my high school numerous times and have helped the community that I live in. As I stated, I like to be helpful, so I hope to motivate others to do the same. I expect to get more females in different fields through education since many become jobless as time moves on. No matter what career I enter, I also wish to become a social media influencer, so other young ladies will work towards what they want to achieve instead of being discouraged by people in their lives. Doing this my influence with impact people worldwide hopefully. As teachers in the past have stated, change the world with your talents.
